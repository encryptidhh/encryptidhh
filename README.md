## 👋 About Me

Hi there! My name is Hanniel Holness. I'm a Forsyth Tech student who's self-studying cybersecurity, based near Winston-Salem, NC. This is my GitHub, which I'm mainly using to work on cybersecurity-related code projects and work and build projects that link to other IT paths, like web development, and software development tooling. 
I am to to code to create people-focused cybersecurity solutions. You might find me working on what I call my "**Personal Cybersecurity Suite**" which focuses on relatively low-tech cybersecurity mitigations for typical devices which will include:
- 🦾 A password strength checker that grades how strong passwords are, and estimates how long they'd take to crack
- 🗄️A password manager to store secure passwords
- 👣 A digital footprint tracker to remove data that hackers could use for initial reconnaissance
- 🎣 An anti-phishing email filter that flags suspicious links and attachments in emails.
- 🎮 A gamified phishing email quiz
- 🚫 A browser extension that detects and blocks suspicious websites (& scripts).

### 🔧 What I'm Doing
I'm making a quick repo for IT helpdesk - I call it "Personal PBQs." (it's just a set of HTML forms that look like A+ PBQs).
