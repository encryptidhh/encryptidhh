## 👋 About Me

![Picture of myself as a graduation marshal for FT's class of '24](https://github.com/encryptidhh/encryptidhh/blob/d033976abbd6ab2f10d947f489ccfaf143b4dd45/GitHub%20readme%20picture.png)

Hi there! My name is Hanniel (pronounced *Han*-yel) Holness. I'm a student at UNC Charlotte, self-studying cybersecurity. This is my GitHub, which I use to build projects related to cybersecurity/IT courses and certifications. 


### 🔧 What I'm Doing
- Studying for CompTIA Network+ (that won't be covered here, unfortunately)
- A set of malware analysis reports that cover string selection, basic static analysis, basic dynamic analysis, and reverse engineering.
