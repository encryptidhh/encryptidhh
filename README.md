## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

![Picture of myself as a graduation marshal for FT's class of '24](https://github.com/encryptidhh/encryptidhh/blob/d033976abbd6ab2f10d947f489ccfaf143b4dd45/GitHub%20readme%20picture.png)

Hi there! My name is Hanniel (pronounced *Han*-yel) Holness. I'm a Forsyth Tech student who's self-studying cybersecurity, based near Winston-Salem, NC. This is my GitHub, which I use to build projects related to cybersecurity/IT courses and certifications. 

### ðŸŽ¯ Target courses/certs:
- TryHackMe: SOC Level 1
- CompTIA A+ (Core 1 & 2)
- CompTIA Net+
- CompTIA Sec+
- HackTheBox: Penetration Tester
- CompTIA Pentest+
- TryHackMe: SOC Level 2
- CompTIA CySA+


### ðŸ”§ What I'm Doing
A malware IOC/YARA rule report - probably a long text with:
- What cyberattack a malware sample was invovled with
- A dedicated IOC report using a sandbox such as any.run
- IOC's mapped to MITRE's ATT&CK and the Pyramid of Pain
- YARA rules based on the sample
